## 📌 1. Introduction

This project aims to develop a web portal for exploring historical Air Quality Index (AQI) and pollution data across major Indian cities (2021–2026). The platform features:
1. **Interactive Dashboard View:** To visualize trends, analyze daily/monthly pollution levels, and compare air quality across cities instantly.
2. **Research Query Engine:** A built-in query system that pairs 30 complex analytical queries from a MariaDB database alongside pre-computed Machine Learning insights and data forecasts.

## 🧩 2. System Architecture

### Frontend (React + Vite)
* Built using React.js for extremely fast UI updates.
* Uses Chart.js for data visualizations.
* Unified dual-panel structure bridging SQL and Machine Learning outputs visually.

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
* Provides API handler loops.
* Resolves dynamic SQL parameter injections seamlessly.
* Handles MariaDB `BigInt` responses to safely serialize aggregative statistical models (`COUNT()`, `PERCENTILE_CONT()`).

### Database (MariaDB)
* Relational structure linking Cities and Daily AQI entries natively.
* Incorporates Window Functions, Subqueries, Correlation routines, and clustering via highly optimized query formulations (`aqiQueries.js`).

### Machine Learning Pipeline (Python)
* Orchestrates data using `tensorflow` for LSTMs, `scikit-learn` for Isolation Forests & K-Means Clustering, and `statsmodels` for cyclic seasonal projections.
* Generates static outputs (PNG plots and JSON) stored in the `frontend/public/ml-results` directory entirely offline.

## 🚀 4. Full System Setup & Execution Guide

Follow these steps exactly in order to launch the full system locally. 

### Step 1: Database Setup (MariaDB)

1. **Install MariaDB** Server.
2. Ensure the CSV files are located inside the `/data` folder.
3. Open your Command Prompt/Terminal and navigate to this project's root folder.
4. Launch the MariaDB Client:
   `"C:\Program Files\MariaDB 12.2\bin\mysql.exe" -u root -p`
5. Enable local infile (necessary for bulk CSV loading):
   `SET GLOBAL local_infile = 1;`
6. Run the Schema layout:
   `SOURCE database/schema.sql;`
7. Run the Seed loader:
   `SOURCE database/seed.sql;`

### Step 2: Configure & Run the Backend
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Create an environment file (`.env`) in the `backend/` folder and add your database configuration:
   ```env
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=admin
   DB_NAME=aqi_db
   PORT=4000
   ```
3. Install dependencies and start the server:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

### Step 3: Run the Machine Learning Pipeline (Python)
*Note: The results are already stored in `frontend/public/` so this is technically optional unless you want to update models or process new database entries.*
1. Navigate to the ML directory:
   ```bash
   cd ml
   ```
2. Install the necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Execute the Master Pipeline Script:
   ```bash
   python generate_all.py
   ```

### Step 4: Run the Frontend Application
1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install npm dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Boot the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Access the web dashboard at `http://localhost:5173/`.
